# Euclidean-Calculator
This code finds the two points among the three provided that have the greatest separation and then details the x and y differences between these points.

This code gets the user to enter three points (each in the "x,y" format) on a cartesian plane, then determines which two points are the farthest apart based on their Euclidean distance
